          <p>My name is Josh Daniell. Google reckons I look something like this.</p>

          <p>I grew up on a ram breeding farm near sunny Masterton in the Wairarapa. Spent most of my days playing chatter rings, collecting Odbodz cards, and waiting for my voice to break.</p>

      <div class="one-half column home-page">
        <p>After school I studied at Canterbury Uni, finishing off the studies with a stint in Copenhagen in Denmark. I then lived in Europe for a while longer, before returning to help out my parents at home who had bitten off a bit more than they could chew. Next came a stint as a lawyer in Auckland, followed by launching a freelance business consultancy. And after that came the current project - co-founding <a href="https://www.snowballeffect.co.nz/" target="_blank">Snowball Effect</a>, an online investment marketplace specialising in young growth companies.</p>
        <p>Please bear with me - this is the first webpage that I've created. It looks shoddy. But as Reid Hoffman said, if you're not embarrassed when you look back on your first iteration, you released it too late.</p>

    <h5>EDA plans</h5>

      <div class="one-half column">
        <p>I'm doing Phase 0 of EDA but unfortunately won't be able to participate in Phase 1. We're running pretty fast at Snowball so I need to make sure I'm committing enough time to my main priority. With Phase 0, I'm hoping to become more familar and comfortable with key web development technologies. The aim is to understand product development better, and even have the rough skills to start building some of my own side projects if that day comes.</p>
