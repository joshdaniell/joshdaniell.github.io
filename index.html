          <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>Please bear with me - this is the first webpage that I've created. It looks shoddy. But as Reid Hoffman said, if you're not embarrassed when you look back on your first iteration, you released it too late.</p>
            <p>There's been a lot to digest in this first week's work. HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Command Line, Text Editors, and Bootstrap. Hope I can keep up with the pace.</p>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>My name is Josh Daniell. I grew up on a ram breeding farm near sunny Masterton in the Wairarapa. After school I studied at Canterbury Uni, finishing off the studies with a stint in Copenhagen in Denmark. I then lived in Europe for a while longer, before returning to help out my parents at home who had bitten off a bit more than they could chew. Next came a stint as a lawyer in Auckland, followed by launching a freelance business consultancy. And after that came the current project - co-founding <a href="https://www.snowballeffect.co.nz/" target="_blank">Snowball Effect</a>, an online investment marketplace specialising in early stage high growth companies.</p>

            <p>I'm doing Phase 0 of EDA but unfortunately won't be able to participate in Phase 1. We're running pretty fast at Snowball so I need to make sure I'm committing enough time to my main priority. With Phase 0, I'm hoping to become more familar and comfortable with key web development technologies. The aim is to understand product development better, and even have the rough skills to start building some of my own side projects.</p>
