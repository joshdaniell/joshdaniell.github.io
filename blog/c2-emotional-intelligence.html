      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        <p>
          My favourite quote was from Viktor Frankl: “Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our happiness.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I really believe that we can feel good despite terrible underlying circumstances. And that we can feel terrible despite amazing underlying circumstances. The biggest learning for me was the assertion that we can change our "baseline" feelings with practice. I'd previously assumed that it's very difficult to change this baseline. But some of Chapter 1 made me think that it's easier and faster than I imagined.

      <h3>How did you find the 2 minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>
          2 minutes is such a short period of time that it seems very doable. Whenever my mind wandered I reminded myself that it won't be much "wasted time" if I don't feel any benefits. I enjoyed letting go of the other things I wanted to get done tonight. I couldn't listen to those thoughts for 2 minutes.
