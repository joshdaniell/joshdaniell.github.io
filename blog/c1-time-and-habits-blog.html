    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>

      <p>
        A few words before the questions. I work roughly 12 hour days and many weekends in my regular job, so squeezing in Phase 0 of EDA was always going to be a stretch. I know I can make it work though, and need to make sure that I'm spending my time efficiently. I also need to make sure I'm sparing enough time to play around and think about things - not just complete tasks as quickly as possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
        <p>
          I already do many of them. For example I always plan my week ahead on a Friday. Then re-adjust each day in the morning. I use a "north star metric" to guide my prioritisation.
        </p>
      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
        <p>
          The content about reflection made me think. I will aim to incorporate that into my days.
        </p>
      <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
        <p>
          I liked something Joseph said about scheduling certain times in the calendar to work on EDA. I think that will work well for me because otherwise I tend to just keep going with my day job which is never-ending.
        </p>
      <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
        <p>
          Reflection and scheduling times for EDA.
