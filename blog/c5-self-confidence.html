        <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
          <p>Apparently they're the same thing.</p>
        <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
          <p>Definitely a fall asleeper while doing Body Scanning... especially in yoga.</p>
          <p></p>
        <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
          <p>I think it's a good framework for emotional resilience.</p>
          <p>However, and this may be a bit contro, I'm not totally sold on removing ourselves from emotions. Something about it feels a little like brainwashing to me. It's often positive brainwashing (like many religious activities). But it still feels a little brainwashy. I think there can be something beautiful about raw human emotion spilling out, even if it's "negative" emotions like sadness, anger, jealosy.</p>
          <p>That said, I do think that our personalities are more than just our raw instincts and emotions. This was summed up beautifully in Harry Potter when he put on the Sorting Hat to decide which house he joined. The Sorting Hat thought he was a natural fit for Slytherin. But Harry wanted to be a Gryfindor kind of guy, and the Sorting Hat was swayed by this part of his personality. I think that's a good metaphor for personalities. They're a mix of innate and learned responses to situations. If someone leans too heavily on learned repsonses, they can be quite PC and robotic. If they rely too heavily on their innate responses, they can be quite assholey.</p>
