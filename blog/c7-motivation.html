        <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
          <p>Agree with this 100%. I've always found it a bit strange that people strive for "happiness" because most of us associate that with the pleasure definition. When in fact the more sustainable definition would be more like "inner peace". I liked the metaphor of the deep ocean with the surface that can change due to temporary events, but a depth which is resiliant.</p>
        <h5>What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h5>
          <p>Decided to instead provide answers to the question "If everything in my life, starting from today, meets or exceeds my most optimistic epectations, what will my life be in five years?"</p>
          <p>I'd like to have a business that generates passive income to the point where I'm financially independent. I'd like the mental space to think about the world and the people I care about. I'd like to do everyday things that make a positive difference and spur on other positive actions.</p>
