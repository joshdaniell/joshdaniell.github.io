        <h5>Reflections from Chapter 7 of Search Inside Yourself</h5>
          <p>I found it interesting to read about the author's experience with his new manager that replaced someone that he liked and felt had been treated unfairly. I've often wondered how it works with CEOs and other managers that fly in from outside the organisation. On one hand they can pretend to not know about existing politics and make objective decisions. On the other hand they can upset the apple cart by not respecting cultural norms that have developed within the organisation.</p>
          <p>Empathetic listing - the takeout for me was to think about how I can let the speaker feel more understood. I think I could do more on that front before responding with my own "points".</p>
          <p>The focus on kindness appeals to me. I think it's a positive practice to develop over time.</p>
