    <h1>The EDA experience</h1>

    <h3>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>
        Seems like a well-constructed course. I've been interested to see the emphasis placed on empathy and collaboration.
      </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>
        Each week will be challenging. I'll take longer than most. I'll need to set aside enough time to play around, rather than "get through" the content.
      </p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this sort of culture?</h3>
      <p>
        I like it. But not sure that I'll be online at the same time as everyone else (late evenings and weekends where possible). So I'm unsure how much value I'll be able to add (and get from) the group dynamics.
      </p>
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>
        I thought Shereef made an important point with the restaurant / kitchen analogy. I knew this before I started EDA, but am know even more convinced that I'll get out what I put in. And I'll need to have time to think and reflect rather than just carry out tasks.
      </p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm nervous due to time commitments. I'm confident that I'll be able to eventually learn the skills. But I'm unsure whether I'll be able to hack the pace given other commitments and lack of background in this area.
      </p>
