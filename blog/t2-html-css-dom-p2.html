      <h3>What is grid based design</h3>
        <p>Each webpage is attached to an underlying grid. This grid allows us to position content.</p>

      <h3>What is all the hype about responsive webpages</h3>
        <p>People browse the web on different devices, which have a wide range of screen sizes and functionality. Responsive webpages allow us to design a single webpage that will provide a good experience for users across a range of devices.</p>

      <h3>What is semantic structure</h3>
        <p>Semantic structure is when you use specific HTML tags to help the browser (and anyone reading your code) to better understand content.</p>
        <p>Semantic tags have meaning, as opposed to generic tags like &lt;div&gt;. Examples of semantic tags include &lt;article&gt; and &lt;form&gt;. These semantic tags clearly define the content for the browser and developer.</p>

      <h3>Other interesting points to reflect on</h3>
        <p>It feels like there must be massive shortcuts for grid based design out there. Perhaps that's why people use frameworks or "drag and drop" website builders. A GUI interface is much more intuitive for arranging elements than coding up boxes and adjusting their attributes. I'll be interested to see whether people use shortcuts for this, and will be interested to see if web designers still need to code basic design frameworks in a few years' time.</p>
        <p>There seems to be quite a few different styles on how to arrange code. I'm starting to develop a preference, but want to see other styles before getting too cemented in how I'm doing it.</p>
        <p>I don't yet understand how other languages like Ruby and PHP fit into the code base yet. Keen to figure that out to help make more sense of the big picture.</p>
