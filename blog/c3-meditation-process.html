        <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
          <p>As I've gotten older I've gotten less willing to experiment with technical stuff that I'm not sure will work. As a kid I wouldn't have minded clicking a button without understanding the consequences. But now I'm more circumspect. So I find the idea of process over product to be a good reminder that experimenting is the fastest way to learn. And that we're not here to complete tasks as quickly as possible.</p>
        <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2</h5>
          <p>Interesting and powerful, but I haven't spent much time trying it out.</p>
        <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
          <p>I liked the analogy of riding a bike, and making small adjustments to retain focus. Some of the physical effects, such as helping with psoriasis and thicking the ceocortex were new to me.</p>
        <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
          <p>Really gelled with the concept that happiness isn't something to strive for - it's the base state. We need to just allow ourselves to be happy. I want to think about this more because we're so conditioned to judging things like happiness in a relative fashion.</p>
        <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
          <p>Must. Use. Headspace. App. I. Downloaded. Ages. Ago.</p>
