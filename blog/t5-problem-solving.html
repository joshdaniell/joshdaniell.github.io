        <h5>Background</h5>
          <p>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
            <ul>
              <li>Got blocked on a simple problem</li>
              <li>Solved a problem in an elegant way</li>
            </ul>
            Answer the following questions for both cases.
          </p>
        <h5>What was the problem?</h5>
          <p>Blocked: I couldn't get console iTerm working properly. I'd been comfortable with it for a couple of weeks, but then it started tracking a whole lot of other files that weren't supposed to be tracked by git. </p>
          <p>Solved: Not sure I've ever solved a dev problem in an elegant way, but sometimes I've been proud of working through and trying to think like the program.</p>
        <h5>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Big fan of the rubber ducky.</li>
            <li>Taking a break.</li>
            <li>Googling examples.</li>
          </ul>
        <h5>How did you feel throughout the process?</h5>
          <p>Frustrated. Incompetent. Then proud if I figured it out...</p>
        <h5>What did you learn?</h5>
          <p>The smallest things can be the downfall of a program. There's a ton of debugging tools available. Fresh eyes (your own or someone else's) can be useful. </p>
        <h5>Reflect on various techniques</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode: I've never used this properly. I something try to use this technique when debugging. Keen to give it a proper try some time.</li>
            <li>Trying something: Very common approach with mixed results...</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky: Commonly used, I'm a fanboy.</li>
            <li>Reading error messages: I try to, but not that confident in interpreting.</li>
            <li>Console.logging: Don't use this enough. No doubt will be using in the upcoming js stuff...</li>
            <li>Googling: Very common, getting better at it.</li>
            <li>Asking peers for help: Not comfortable with this - mostly because I'm behind everyone else so don't want to disrupt their flow.</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help: Comfortable doing this but would prefer not to because I usually want to move on quickly rather than wait for a response.</li>
            <li>Improving process with reflection: I can see the value, and keen to start incorporating this more (into more things than just dev!).</li>
          </ul>
        <h5>JavaScript stuff for theoretical friend who's interested</h5>
          <p>There's a function called <code>.reduce()</code>. Bloody handy if you want to apply a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value. Can't tell you much more than that sorry.</p>
          <p>
            There's another function you'll be pleased to know about called <code>.map()</code>. They say this is useful to create a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array. Essentially a shortcut for creating a new list, and the list will be comprised of the output from running a program over every item in the original list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any then the last one I wanted to tell you about is <code>.filter()</code>. This functon creates a new array with all of the elements of this array for which the provided filtering function returns true. You may want to use this when you want to duplicate an array, but with only specific parts of the contents.
