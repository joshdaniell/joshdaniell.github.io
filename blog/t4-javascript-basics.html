        <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
          <p>HTML is an application to create the elements and content of a webpage. CSS is an application to style those HTML elements and content. At this stage, we have a static webpage without any dynamic user functionality. That's where JavaScript comes in.</p>
          <p>JavaScript is a programming language. It enables interactivity on a webpage, such as feedback forms and logging in. JavaScript is one of the many languages that a webpage can use to dynamically request data from a database when instructed, and then change the experience for the user on the webpage. This is what distuinguishes a dynmaic webpage from a "static" webpage.</p>
        <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h5>
          <p>Control flow is the order in which instructions in a program are executed. A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached.</p>
          <p>Control flow for opening my emails would be something like: turn on computer > enter password > open browser > login to Gmail. These instructions must be carried out in the correct sequence otherwise the the program will fail to execute. A loop during a fire drill would be like the fire warden checking each room systematically until all rooms in the building have been checked.</p>
        <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h5>
          <p>An array is an object with multiple elements. To access a specific element, we simply call the psotition of the element within the array. An object can have multiple properties. However to access the value of a property we call the "key" of that property.</p>
        <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h5>
          <p>A function is a program. It's a set of instructions that execute when called. We write functions and give them a name. Then we call the function whenever needed in the code. Since we've already written the function and defined it, we can reuse that function very simply in other parts of the code base.</p>
