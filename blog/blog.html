        <h4>The EDA experience</h4>
        <h5>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h5>
          <p>Seems like a well-constructed course. I've been interested to see the emphasis placed on empathy and collaboration.</p>
        <h5>What are your impressions?</h5>
          <p>Each week will be challenging. I'll take longer than most. I'll need to set aside enough time to play around, rather than "get through" the content.</p>
        <h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this sort of culture?</h5>
          <p>I like it. But not sure that I'll be online at the same time as everyone else (late evenings and weekends where possible). So I'm unsure how much value I'll be able to add (and get from) the group dynamics.</p>
        <h5>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h5>
          <p>I thought Shereef made an important point with the restaurant / kitchen analogy. I knew this before I started EDA, but am know even more convinced that I'll get out what I put in. And I'll need to have time to think and reflect rather than just carry out tasks.</p>
        <h5>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h5>
          <p>I'm nervous due to time commitments. I'm confident that I'll be able to eventually learn the skills. But I'm unsure whether I'll be able to hack the pace given other commitments and lack of background in this area.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="one-half column">
        <h4>Time and Habits</h4>
          <p>A few words before the questions. I work roughly 12 hour days and many weekends in my regular job, so squeezing in Phase 0 of EDA was always going to be a stretch. I know I can make it work though, and need to make sure that I'm spending my time efficiently. I also need to make sure I'm sparing enough time to play around and think about things - not just complete tasks as quickly as possible.</p>
        <h5>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5>
            <p>I already do many of them. For example I always plan my week ahead on a Friday. Then re-adjust each day in the morning. I use a "north star metric" to guide my prioritisation.</p>
        <h5>What did you find interesting?</h5>
            <p>The content about reflection made me think. I will aim to incorporate that into my days.</p>
        <h5>What worked for you?</h5>
            <p>I liked something Joseph said about scheduling certain times in the calendar to work on EDA. I think that will work well for me because otherwise I tend to just keep going with my day job which is never-ending.</p>
        <h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5>
            <p>Reflection and scheduling times for EDA.</p>

        <h5>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h5>
          <p>My favourite quote was from Viktor Frankl: “Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our happiness.”</p>
          <p>I really believe that we can feel good despite terrible underlying circumstances. And that we can feel terrible despite amazing underlying circumstances. The biggest learning for me was the assertion that we can change our "baseline" feelings with practice. I'd previously assumed that it's very difficult to change this baseline. But some of Chapter 1 made me think that it's easier and faster than I imagined.</p>
        <h5>How did you find the 2 minutes of mindfulness?</h5>
          <p>2 minutes is such a short period of time that it seems very doable. Whenever my mind wandered I reminded myself that it won't be much "wasted time" if I don't feel any benefits. I enjoyed letting go of the other things I wanted to get done tonight. I couldn't listen to those thoughts for 2 minutes.</p>

        <h5>Analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM</h5>
          <p>HTML contains the content that will be displayed on a webpage. CSS contains the style rules that will be applied to that content. HTML and CSS are kept in separate documents to make a wesbite more modular and easier to scale.</p>
          <p>The DOM is the combined HTML and CSS that the browser uses to display content on a webpage. It could be exactly the same as the HTML code, but it could also differ due to Javascript or other code which changes the content before or after it's rendered.</p>
          <p>Now I need an analogy. How about an excel spreadsheet which includes macros that update certain inputs. If you send that spreadsheet (the HTML code in this analogy) old mate Trevor, he could open that using his Microsoft sofware (the browser) and see exactly the same "HTML content". However the macros could pull in new data to create a modified version of the spreadsheet that was originally sent to Trevor. This modified version (the "DOM") is what is rendered through Trevor's "browser". It's analagous to the DOM that your Chrome brower renders after compiling the HTML, CSS, and any other scripts included in the code.</p>
        <h5>What is meant by boxifying design</h5>
          <p>Every webpage consists of an underlying grid. Every bit of content will sit somewhere on this grid.</p>
          <p>In order to modify the default layout, we need to define the position and charactistics of each bit of content. The easiest way to do this is to group relevant chunks of content into boxes (also called containers). Once we have content in a container, we can apply styling and rules to that container to manipulate its characteristics. These design rules can then be easily applied to other relevant containers by giving them the same "class" or "id".</p>
          <p>Boxifying design makes code easier to understand, easier to manipulate, more modular, and more scalable.</p>
        <h5>What is the box model</h5>
          <p>As above, the box model refers to the fact that the content on every webpage is attached to an underlying grid. An understanding of the box model is required in order to manipulate the design of the content.</p>
        <h5>Design and structural features that I'd like to use in designs next week</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Sticky header.</li>
            <li>Centered content that dynamically adjusts as the browser window changes size.</li>
            <li>Get comfortable creating columns.</li>
            <li>Get comfortable using floats.</li>
            <li>Get comfortable understanding and using Bootstrap.</li>
            <li>Get comfortable with the default code for beginning a CSS file (CSS reset and any other relevant code related to Bootstrap or other).</li>
          </ul>

        <h5>What is grid based design</h5>
          <p>Each webpage is attached to an underlying grid. This grid allows us to position content.</p>
        <h5>What is all the hype about responsive webpages</h5>
          <p>People browse the web on different devices, which have a wide range of screen sizes and functionality. Responsive webpages allow us to design a single webpage that will provide a good experience for users across a range of devices.</p>
        <h5>What is semantic structure</h5>
          <p>Semantic structure is when you use specific HTML tags to help the browser (and anyone reading your code) to better understand content.</p>
          <p>Semantic tags have meaning, as opposed to generic tags like &lt;div&gt;. Examples of semantic tags include &lt;article&gt; and &lt;form&gt;. These semantic tags clearly define the content for the browser and developer.</p>
        <h5>Other interesting points to reflect on</h5>
          <p>It feels like there must be massive shortcuts for grid based design out there. Perhaps that's why people use frameworks or "drag and drop" website builders. A GUI interface is much more intuitive for arranging elements than coding up boxes and adjusting their attributes. I'll be interested to see whether people use shortcuts for this, and will be interested to see if web designers still need to code basic design frameworks in a few years' time.</p>
          <p>There seems to be quite a few different styles on how to arrange code. I'm starting to develop a preference, but want to see other styles before getting too cemented in how I'm doing it.</p>
          <p>I don't yet understand how other languages like Ruby and PHP fit into the code base yet. Keen to figure that out to help make more sense of the big picture.</p>
